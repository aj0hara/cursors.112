# cursors.112
Welcome! This project is meant to be a spinoff of the formerly popular online multiplayer game, cursors.io! 
I created this as my final term project when I took 15-112: Fundamentals of Programming, an introductory CS course taught in Python at Carnegie Mellon University.

## Description
This is a maze based game, where the player has to drag a dot from the beginning to the end of the maze in a certain amount of time. As time goes by, however, the maze's walls start to close in. If the player’s cursor collides with the wall, the dot resets back to the beginning of the maze. 

I built this game with Python and Tkinter, using the DFS maze algorithm, backtracking, 3D lists, MVC framework, and object-oriented-programming to develop all of the game logic.

[Here](https://tinyurl.com/cursors112)'s a demo video where I run through all of the game's features!

## Run the Game
**Libraries & modules to be installed:** <br />
PIL/Pillow and Requests <br />

**Run:** <br />
Once the respective libraries & modules have been installed, run “Base.py” to launch the game.

## In-game debugging shortcuts: <br />
Press “s” to reveal the maze's solution <br />
Press “r” to reset the entire game <br />
Press “p” in game to generate a new maze <br />
Press “z” to lose <br />
Press “w” to win <br />
Press “c” to speed up the timer to 1 second <br />
