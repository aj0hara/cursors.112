# cursors.112
A maze spinoff of the formerly popular online multiplayer game, cursors.io! 

I created this as my term project for 15-112, an introductory Python programming course at Carnegie Mellon University.

**Game Description:** <br />
This is a maze based game, where the player has to drag a dot from the beginning to the end of the maze in a certain amount of time. As time goes by, however, the maze's walls start to close in. If the player’s cursor collides with the wall, the dot resets back to the beginning of the maze. I created this game using Python, Tkinter, the DFS maze algorithm, backtracking, 3D lists, the MVC framework, and object-oriented-programming.
